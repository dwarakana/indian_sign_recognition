**Indian Sign Language Recognition**

Sign Language Recognition System aims to rephrase sign language into text or speech to ease communication between deaf and hearing individuals.
This issue has far-reaching implications but remains exceptionally hard due to the complexity and large variation of hand movements.
This project suggests a new (SVM) that can automatically extract discriminative spatial-temporal elements extracted without information known from unprocessed video streams and avoid designing features.

**Installation required**
1. Python
2. Opencv
3. Scikit-learn for (Support Vector Machine )

**image_capture.py** :
        Its for imagesets to collect as data.
        
**imagePreprocessingUtils.py** : 
        For pre-define function of ORB, Canny_edge and other preprocessing concept.

**image_preprocessing.py** : 
        Train the K-mean and SVM model.

**recogniseGesture.py** : 
        Real time live predicton for recognisation.
